50eb1df8b589e4664c000535,Amazon's Streaming Video Library Now a Little Easier to Navigate,10,12,amazon uncategorized media entertainment video,entertainment,Lauren Indvik,2013-01-07 19:11:36 +0000 +0000,Monday,1251,https://mashable.com/2013/01/07/amazon-instant-video-browser/?scheme=http,"Having trouble finding something to watch on Amazon Instant Video? The retailer launched Monday an experimental browsing tool that lets users discover movies and TV shows based on their genre preferences or simply the mood they're in.Movies and shows are divided up into categories, some of which bear the names of genres (i.e., ""Comedy"" and ""Mystery/Thriller""), and others which are labeled by mood, such as ""Feel-Good"" and ""Exciting."" Users can toggle between TV shows and movies, and apply filters to show only videos that are available for free viewing to Prime subscribers, or ones that bear G or PG ratings.It's pretty basic, but it sure beats the haphazard organization of Amazon's current Instant Video page, which mixes rows of new releases with bestsellers and personal recommendations.The move is the latest in a series of investment's Amazon is making in its streaming video platform. Last week, the company inked a licensing agreement with A+E Networks to bring past seasons of shows from A&E, History, Lifetime and Bio to its streaming library â€” shows, it should be noted, that Netflix subscribers lost access to in the fall. Amazon claims its streaming Prime catalog now numbers more than 33,000, double what it was a year ago.Screenshot courtesy of Amazon.com",4,2,593,0,

The AP announced Monday that it will share sponsored tweets from Samsung throughout this week for the International CES taking place in Las Vegas. The news service will let Samsung post two tweets per day to the AP's Twitter account, which has more than 1.5 million users, and each of these tweets will be labeled ""SPONSORED TWEETS.""This marks the first time that the AP has sold advertising on its Twitter feed, and the company says it spent months developing guidelines to pave the way for this and other new media business models. For this particular promotion, Samsung will provide the sponsored tweets and non-editorial staff at the AP will handle the publishing side. In this way, the company hopes to maintain a clear dividing line between its editorial and advertising operations on Twitter.""We are thrilled to be taking this next step in social media,"" said Lou Ferrara, the AP managing editor overseeing its social media efforts, in a statement. ""As an industry, we must be looking for new ways to develop revenues while providing good experiences for advertisers and consumers. At the same time, advertisers and audiences expect AP to do that without compromising its core mission of breaking news."" Other publishers have dabbled in Twitter ads, including The Atlantic, National Journal, The Times-Picayune and BreakingNews.com.Image courtesy of Flickr, nan palmero",3,1,711,0,
